Notes:

- Always filter out the '\n' from the challenge files
- The file in challenge 10 is base 64 encoded
- [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#CBC) is a great explanation for
how CBC encryption works
- Challenge 12 gives a VERY rough outline. Step 3 is insightfull, 4 & 5 & 6 are borderline misleading.
